# EGUI-Projects
Projects created by me within the confines of Graphical User Interfaces subject. Generally projects relied on creating calendar in 3 different ways: Qt, ASP.NET, React + .NET. Calendar consists of three screens. The first screen shows the calendar, the second - day screen which aim is to display the list of events in a given day. The last screen shows screen of adding/editing single event.
